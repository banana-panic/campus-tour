The current Amelia Gayle Gorgas Library was built in 1939 and the pre-existing Gorgas Library was renamed Carmichael Hall. It was decided that the new Gorgas would be built where the old University Library had been before the Civil War. Ruins of the old library can be found underneath the semi-circular plaza in front of the building. Gorgas is named for the universityM-^Rs postmistress and librarian Amelia Gayle Gorgas (1826-1913) who was the wife of Confederate General Josiah Gorgas (1818-1883), the UniversityM-^Rs 8th president and librarian.
