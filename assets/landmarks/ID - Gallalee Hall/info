Gallalee Hall, built in 1949, is home to the Department of Physics and Astronomy in the College of Arts & Sciences. The building houses the Physics Machine Shop, Physics Electronics Shop, and Laser Lab, and is used by the High-Energy Physics group for research.

The astronomy group maintains a domed observatory on the roof of Gallalee Hall. A new, state-of-the-art telescope was installed in the observatory in 2005, replacing the 10-inch refracting telescope that had been in use since 1950.

“Public Night” sky-viewing sessions are held in Gallalee Hall using the telescope.
