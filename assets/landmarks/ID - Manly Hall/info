Manly Hall, built in 1885 and named after the University's 2nd president Reverend Basil Manly, contains the Department of Religious Studies and the Department of Women's Studies. The building has a break room with a small library located on the second floor.

Manly Hall was built at the same time as Clark Hall and originally housed dorm rooms, the University president's office, and lecture rooms for law, engineering, mathematics, and Greek. The president's office was located on the ground floor and remained there until 1940.
