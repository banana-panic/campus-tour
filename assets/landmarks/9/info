The 2,800-square foot Sarah Moody Gallery of Art houses the Permanent Collection with a schedule of art exhibits throughout the school year. The gallery is open from 9:00 am to 4:30 pm on weekdays and 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm on Thursday evenings. There is no admission charge to view the works.

Garland Hall was built in 1888 to house the first Museum of Natural History and provide more dorm rooms for the expanding campus. Professor Eugene Allen Smith's offices were also located in the first floor of the building along with the museum. They stayed there until the construction of Smith Hall in 1911. In 1967 the much used space was transformed into an art gallery which was named after Sarah McCorkle Moody who donated a Picasso print to the Art Department in 1950.
