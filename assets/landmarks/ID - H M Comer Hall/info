H.M. Comer Hall houses the Engineering Student Services Office, Capstone Engineering Society, and the Dean's Office for the College of Engineering.

An auditorium and meeting room are located on the first floor along with classrooms and labs. The second floor offers a graduate student lounge, offices, classrooms, and computer lab while the third floor has labs, classrooms, student study lounge, and faculty offices.

H.M. Comer was built in 1962, and named for Hugh Moss Comer, a Birmingham industrialist who had served as the Greater University Campaign's first chairman. Hugh Moss Comer was also the son of Braxton Bragg Comer for whom B.B. Comer Hall, the first engineering building on campus, was named. Because of this there was some confusion as to which Comer Hall a student had classes in. Thus, students started to use 'Mineral Industries Building' in order to refer to H.M. Comer. The building was also used to house the engineering library until the completion of Rodgers Library in 1990.
