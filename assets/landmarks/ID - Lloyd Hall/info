Lloyd Hall was built as the new home for the expanding Chemistry Department in 1927 and existed in that capacity for 77 years. In 2004, when Shelby Hall was constructed, the department moved and now Lloyd is used for interdisciplinary sciences. In August of 2009 the Writing Center moved from Morgan Hall into Lloyd.

The Writing Center, located on the third floor, provides a free writing tutorial service for students in all fields and at all levels of study. The center helps students develop their writing skills as they work through specific writing assignments or projects.

Lloyd Hall was named in honor of Stewart J. Lloyd, the first Dean of the School of Chemistry, Metallurgy, and Ceramics. It housed the Science Library prior to the construction of Rodgers Library.

The ground floor of Lloyd has a small lounge area and a food court consisting of Java City, Pizza Hutt, Chick-fil-A, and Boar's Head Brand that was installed in the summer of 2010.
