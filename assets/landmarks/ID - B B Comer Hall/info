B.B. Comer Hall, named for Braxton Bragg Comer and built around the same time as Smith Hall (1907-1910), was the first home of the College of Engineering and was known simply as Comer Hall. The south wing contained the physics and electrical engineering departments on the first floor and the engineering library and dean's office, and classrooms upstairs.

The center part of the building also held the University's power plant which included a boiler, dynamo, heating and plumbing machinery, and coal apparatus. The smoke stack was added in 1967. However, in 1936 the College of Engineering left Comer and moved to Hardaway Hall. Finally in 1961 the building was remodeled for the College of Arts and Sciences use.
