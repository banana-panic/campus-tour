The Tom Bevill Energy, Mineral, and Material Science Research Building is The University of Alabama's first facility dedicated solely to research. The approximately 217,000-square-foot, three-level building includes labs, classrooms, conference rooms, offices, lounges, and storage rooms.

Laboratory space totals almost 17,000 square feet, including 1,000 square feet for a Class 100 and a Class 1000 clean room. Bevill also has an indoor garden located in the center of the building and an open air lounge on the second floor over the garden area.

The Center for Materials for Information Technology (MINT) is an interdisciplinary group of scientists and engineers interested in developing new materials for information storage technologies located in the Bevill Building. Their offices and labs are located on the second floor along with the Department of Geological Sciences.

The facility, opened in 1990, is named in honor of Congressman Tom Bevill of the Fourth District of Alabama who had a key role in obtaining the federal contribution for the building as well as the AIME building.
