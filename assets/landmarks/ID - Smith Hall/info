Smith Hall is home to the Department of Geological Sciences and the Alabama Museum of Natural History. The building has extensive displays of geology, zoology, mineralogy, paleontology, ethnology, history, and photography. Also on display are the Hodges meteorite, the only meteorite confirmed to have struck a human, and the State Fossil of Alabama: Basilosaurus cetoides.

The upper floor houses a lecture hall along with several geological teaching laboratories and offices. The museum is situated on the ground floor as well as the upper floor’s center area. Operating hours and other information can be found on the Alabama Museum of Natural History Web site. UA students and faculty have free admission.

Smith Hall, constructed in 1910, was named for Eugene Allen Smith, a UA professor and State Geologist. The building's Beaux-Arts architecture was meant to reflect, on a smaller scale, the grandiose national history museums built in Chicago, New York, and Washington.
