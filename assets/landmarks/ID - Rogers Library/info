Rodgers Library was built in 1990 and named after Dr. Eric Rodgers, who was a physics professor and the Dean of the Graduate School from 1958 to 1971, and his wife Sarah Rodgers, who was a statistics professor at UA. The science collection from Lloyd Hall and the engineering collection from Bevill were transferred to Rodgers upon the building's completion. The nursing collection was added in 2005.
