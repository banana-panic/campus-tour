Shelby Hall is a 200,000-plus square-foot facility and is UA's largest academic building. The pentagon-shaped hall is one of the most sophisticated campus science facilities in the nation and is the home of the Department of Chemistry and UA research coalitions and centers in transportation, geosciences, energy, biosciences, chemical sciences, and material sciences.

Shelby has 70 research labs, five teaching labs, three theatre-style lecture halls, 40 offices for faculty and professional staff, and 80 offices for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. An on-site glass blowing facility creates glassware for use in research projects. Rest areas are scattered throughout the building and a convenience store is also located on the first floor.

The building was finished in 2004 and named in honor of U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby and his wife, Dr. Annette N. Shelby.
