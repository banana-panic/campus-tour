Nott Hall was built in 1922 as the University’s medical school building and named after the founder of the school, Dr. Josiah Nott. In 1945, the school moved to Birmingham and the Department of Biology took over the building. However, in 1971 the new biology building was created and Nott Hall underwent extensive remodeling to open in 1975 as the home of the Departments of Behavioral Science, Microbiology, Community Medicine, and Internal Medicine. It also once housed the College of Community Health Sciences Dean’s Office.
